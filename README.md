This program is about a Banking System,
which uses encryption of the Banking accounts.

I use cryptography module to generate private and public keys
to make the Encryption.

Comments are features which will be added

How it should work:

- Create an Account 
    - Generating a card file
    - Generation private and public key
    - saving the card file
    - encrypt the card file
    // The card file will not be deleted
    // as i plan it to be a system where you don't need the keys
    // also the card file should be safed only on the central Bank.
    // the teminal can access the unencrypted file to check the login data

- Login
    - enter card number and pin
    - check if login is correct
    // A verification system would be nice

- Account
    // Files get decrypted as the user needs its content
    // Card number needs to be put in to transfer money
    // Make a Money transfer system using the keys
